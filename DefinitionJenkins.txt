Jenkins is a build factory. In other words, its primary use is to run tasks that dedicated to build, integrate and deliver applications. It's a typical DEVOPS tool.

Jenkins can be used to build pipelines (sequences of tasks) or to be called from a pipeline (to execute one of the pipeline's tasks).

The great thing about Jenkins is that it integrates nicely with other devops tools:

SCM: SVN, Github, Gitlab
Build: maven, gradle
Test: Cucumber reports
Quality: SonarQube
Deployment: Octopus Deploy, XL Deploy, Run Deck...
You name it!

However, Jenkins is generally not used to "code" and "operated" applications.

A typical pipeline would be:

Try Pull Request => Build Release Candidate => Deploy RC on Integration => Deploy on Production
This is a over simplified pipeline, just to give an idea of the scope of this tool. A production grade piepline should include security checks, and integrate nicely with human validation when needed.
